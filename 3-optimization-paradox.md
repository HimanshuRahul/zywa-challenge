## Optimization Paradox

You're given three conflicting optimization goals:

- Minimize processing time
- Maximize accuracy
- Minimize resource usage

### The Twist:

- Improving any one metric must worsen at least one other
- The relationship between metrics is non-linear
- System requirements change every hour
- Resource costs follow an unpredictable pattern

### Tasks:

- Design an adaptive system that handles these constraints
- Explain your approach to balancing trade-offs
- Create a decision matrix for different scenarios
- Propose monitoring and adjustment mechanisms

## System Design for the Optimization Paradox

### Problem Understanding

In this challenge, the goal is to design an adaptive system that optimally balances three conflicting metrics:

- Minimize processing time
- Maximize accuracy
- Minimize resource usage

Each improvement in one metric comes at the expense of the others. Further complexities include:

- Non-linear relationships between metrics.
- Dynamic system requirements that change hourly.
- Unpredictable resource costs.
- Improvment in any one metric will worsen at least one other matric.

### Design Overview

The system consists of the following core components:

- Data Collection Layer: Gathers real-time metrics like processing time, accuracy, resource costs, and changing requirements.
- Decision Engine: Implements trade-off balancing using a weighted scoring system, leveraging approaches like weighted round robin for resource allocation.
- Execution Layer: Dynamically adjusts system configurations based on decisions.
- Monitoring and Feedback Mechanisms: Continuously monitors performance metrics and iteratively refines the decision-making process.

### Data Collection Layer

- The Data Collection Layer aggregates inputs from various sources:

  - System Metrics: Processing times, accuracy scores, and resource utilization statistics.
  - External Inputs: Hourly system requirement changes and resource cost fluctuations.

- Tools & Implementation:

  - Use Prometheus for metrics collection and AWS CloudWatch for real-time monitoring.
  - Store historical data in PostgreSQL for analysis and trend prediction.

### Decision Engine

- The Decision Engine determines how to balance trade-offs using a dynamic decision matrix. It uses:

- Weighted Scoring System:

Assign weights to each metric based on current priorities.
Example formula:

`Score = (W1 * Accuracy) - (W2 * Processing Time) - (W3 * Resource Usage)`
The weights (W1, W2, W3) are adjusted dynamically.

- Weighted Round Robin for Resource Allocation:

  - Inspired by the load balancer project, tasks are prioritized using a weighted round robin approach.
  - Tasks with higher priority (based on weights) get a larger share of resources, while less critical tasks are assigned fewer resources.

    - Example:
      - High Accuracy Priority: More resources allocated to compute-intensive, high-accuracy models.
      - Low Resource Cost Priority: Allocate resources to lighter, faster models.

- Constraint Management:
  Define boundaries for acceptable performance:
  - Accuracy ≥ 90%
  - Processing Time ≤ 2 seconds
    Resource Usage ≤ 75% of available capacity
    Ensure decisions respect these constraints.

### Execution Layer

The Execution Layer dynamically adjusts system configurations in real-time:

- Model Selection: Switch between lightweight and complex models based on priorities.
- Resource Scaling: Use AWS Auto Scaling to dynamically provision or de-provision resources based on real-time needs.
- Task Routing: Route tasks to different processing units using the weighted round robin scheduler to optimize load distribution and resource usage.

### Monitoring and Feedback Mechanisms

A robust Monitoring and Feedback System ensures continuous adaptability:

- Real-time Monitoring:

  - Tools: Grafana for visualization, Prometheus for metric tracking.
  - Metrics: Processing time, accuracy, resource usage, system costs.

- Feedback Loop:

  - Analyze performance after every iteration.
  - Update weights and decision-making rules in the Decision Engine based on observed outcomes.

- Predictive Analytics:
  - Use historical data trends to forecast:
    - Resource cost spikes.
    - Likely system requirement changes.
  - Preemptively adjust weights and configurations.

### Decision Matrix

Here’s an adaptive decision matrix to guide the system under different scenarios:

| **Scenario**                                 | **Priority**        | **Action**                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Low resource cost, accuracy critical**     | Maximize Accuracy   | Allocate more resources to high-accuracy models; allow slower processing time.               |
| **High resource cost, fast response needed** | Minimize Time       | Switch to fast, low-resource algorithms; sacrifice some accuracy.                            |
| **Tight deadlines with cost constraints**    | Minimize Time, Cost | Use lightweight models and route tasks using weighted round robin to distribute load evenly. |
| **Changing requirements**                    | Balanced            | Dynamically adjust weights in the scoring formula to reflect current priorities.             |

### Workflow Example

Scenario: High Accuracy with Moderate Resource Costs

- Input: Resource cost is stable, and the system requires high accuracy.
- Decision:
  - Assign higher weight to accuracy in the scoring system.
  - Use compute-intensive models for processing tasks.
  - Scale up resources as needed using AWS Auto Scaling.
- Execution:
  - Route tasks to processing units with sufficient capacity using weighted round robin.
  - Monitor accuracy and resource usage in real-time.
- Feedback: If resource usage exceeds 80%, shift to slightly faster models to balance the load.

### Technical Stack

To implement this system, the following technologies and tools are recommended:

- Backend:

  - Node.js: Efficient for implementing the decision engine.
  - Python: For predictive analytics and machine learning components.

- Resource Management:

  - AWS Auto Scaling: Dynamic resource allocation.
  - Kubernetes: For containerized deployment and load balancing.

- Database:

  - PostgreSQL: For storing historical data and system metrics.

- Monitoring Tools:

  - Prometheus & Grafana: For real-time monitoring and visualization.

- Machine Learning Framework:

  - TensorFlow: Optional, for training models to predict non-linear relationships and system behavior.

### Key Advantages

- Adaptability: The system dynamically adjusts to changing requirements and costs.
- Efficiency: Weighted round robin ensures fair and optimized resource allocation.
- Scalability: Auto-scaling supports high loads without over-provisioning.
- Continuous Improvement: Real-time feedback refines decisions iteratively.
